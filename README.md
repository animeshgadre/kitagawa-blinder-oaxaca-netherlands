This is a small, unserious exercise capturing the changes in the gender wage gap in Netherlands with the oaxaca package on R. I try to decompose the wage gap with the help of the Kitagawa-Blinder-Oaxaca method. I originally intended to do this exercise on Python but I came around to the conclusion that itâ€™s neater and more convenient on R. Be that as it may, the functionality of oaxaca package in R still somewhat limited (for instance, it can treat only one categorical variable at a time) and this decomposition is best executed on STATA.
